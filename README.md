# yugioh-price-checker-project
Hi, this is a project learning about how to utilize APIs, express, SQL and React all together.

#Purpose
Yugioh has been an impactful recreational activity for me. A large part of the enjoyment in the game was the strategy. Looking for cards and assembling decks with unique and unusual strategies has always been my interest in the game. As a result, I spent a ton of time looking for cards in card shops and online marketplaces. I would have multiple tabs open for eBay, amazon, TCG Player and trollandtoad. I created this app with the purpose of saving the time of comparing the prices of a single card among all the online marketplaces it's listed on.

#Technologies Used
1. ReactJS
2. Vite
3. HTML, CSS
4. Express.js
5. mySQL

#Concerns
1. I know that the API that I obtained all the card and price info isn't actively updated. For now, I am content with this because the main purpose of this project was to learn full-stack web development. The API provided data for the search results.
2. The website might look at bit sketchy. I'm not a designer, but im trying to make changes to it to make it look more towards the theme I'm going for.
